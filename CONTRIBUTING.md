# Contribution Guidelines

Hello! Thanks for your interest in joining the mission to accelerate the mass adoption of crypto for personal
sovereignty! We welcome contributions from anyone on the internet, and are grateful for even the smallest of fixes!

## Ways to contribute

There are many ways to contribute:

1. Open issues: if you find a bug, have something you believe needs to be fixed, or have an idea for a feature, please
   open an issue.
2. Add color to existing issues: provide screenshots, code snippets, and whatever you think would be helpful to resolve
   issues.
3. Resolve issues: either by showing an issue isn't a problem and the current state is ok as is or by fixing the problem
   and opening a PR.

## Fixing issues

To contribute code fixing issues, please fork the repo, fix an issue, commit, add documentation as per the PR template,
and the repo's maintainers will review the PR.
